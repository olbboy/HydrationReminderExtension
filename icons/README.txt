These icons are required for the Hydration Reminder extension to display properly in Chrome.
They should be in PNG format with transparency and represent a water or hydration theme 
(e.g., a water drop, a glass of water, etc.).

You can create these icons using image editing software or find free icon sets online.
Make sure the icons follow Chrome's guidelines and are properly sized.
